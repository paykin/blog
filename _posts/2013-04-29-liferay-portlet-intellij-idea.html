You can develop Liferay portlets with IntelliJ IDEA exactly as in Eclipse Liferay IDE. Follow simple steps:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Create debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA using Local Tomcat</span></li>
	<li>Configure deployment artifact: add your WAR as "yourwar:war exploded"</li>
	<li>Create XML file with name "yourwar.xml" with the following content:
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context 
  docBase="/absolute/path/to/project/yourwar" 
  reloadable="false" 
  path="/yourwar"/&gt;</pre>
Please note, docBase have to be the same as "Output directory" setting in ItelliJ IDEA of the artifact you deploy. Also, path have to be the same as "Application context" in Run/Debug configuration</li>
	<li>Create post deployment action that will copy just created XML to Liferay's autodeploy folder.</li>
</ol>
Enjoy automatic deployment, hot-swap and debugging your LIferay application.

For additional instructions that you have to follow consider <a href="http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Running+Liferay+from+IntelliJ" title="Liferay official wiki" target="_blank">Liferay official wiki</a>.

Please note, I tested it with IntelliJ IDEA 12.1 and Liferay 6.0.5 on Tomcat 6
