JBoss AS 7 by default do not reflect any changes to JSP files in WAR deployment. So, during application development you have to redeploy WAR or restart JBoss. In order to change this behaviour it is necessary to change section of urn:jboss:domain:web:1.0 in standalone.xml so it looks like:
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:web:1.0" default-virtual-server="default-host"&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;jsp-configuration development="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
    ...
&lt;/subsystem&gt;</pre>
And now JBoss behaves as you expect it in development mode: all changes to JSP files are loaded automatically as soon as you change the JSP file.
