For those of you who work a lot with Eclipse,
you probably run into all sorts of strange errors in Eclipse that
not really related to your code, and then you get the feeling that Eclipse has gone mad.

One way to solve these problems and clean the Eclipse is using -clean argument.
all you need to do is to edit the eclipse.ini file located in your <Eclipse install directory> and add it as the first argument on the first line.
After you upload the eclipse you can delete it until the next time you will need it.
